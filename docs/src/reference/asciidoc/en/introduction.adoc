== Introduction

=== Web Authentication

Web Authentication is a new, secure web application authentication specification standardizing under W3C.
By combining local authentication, public-key authentication, per-origin key management, it provides strong authentication to web sites against authentication process attacks like phishing.
Implementation is in progress in major browsers, the specification offers excellent choices for users who place importance on security and convenience.
Initially, the specification was developed as "FIDO 2.0: Web API for accessing FIDO 2.0 credentials" by the FIDO Alliance, but it has been transferred to W3C.

=== WebAuthn4J Spring Security

WebAuthn4J Spring Security is a Spring Security extension module to provide Web Authentication specification support for your Spring web application.

==== WebAuthn4J

WebAuthn4J Spring Security uses https://github.com/webauthn4j/webauthn4j[WebAuthn4J] for WebAuthn attestation and assertion verification.
WebAuthn4J is a portable Java library that supports all the attestation statements, but has minimal dependencies on external libraries.

==== Spring Security Passkeys

Since Spring Security 6.4, https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/authentication/passkeys.html[passkey support has been added to `spring-security-web`]. It uses the WebAuthn4J library too, but is maintained by the Spring Security project.
On the other hand, this WebAuthn4J Spring Security is maintained by the WebAuthn4J project.
